# MultiChord

A LV2 MIDI plugin to trigger chords from single MIDI notes. Each note of the octave can be individually configured to trigger up to a four note chord. Each note of the chord may be up to an octave below or above the trigger note. Notes from different octaves will trigger chords from the same relative octave. This differs from other chord plugins which may define one chord that can be replayed from any note. This plugin allows configuration of twelve chords.
